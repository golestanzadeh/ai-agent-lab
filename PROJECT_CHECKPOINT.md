# Project Checkpoint

## Purpose

This file is the mandatory, session-independent entry point for AI-Tax-Agent. It exists so a change of ChatGPT conversation, Codex session, or Agent process never requires the human to reconstruct project history.

Chat history is working context only. GitHub documentation is durable project memory.

## Mandatory startup protocol

Before answering a project-status question, proposing work, or asking the human for project facts, every ChatGPT/Codex/Agent session must:

1. Read this file from the active development branch.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`.
3. Read every authoritative file listed under **Required references** that is relevant to the requested work.
4. Check the current branch/PR head and identify whether `main` is behind the active development branch.
5. Prefer the latest dated human-confirmed checkpoint over older technical checkpoints.
6. Never ask the human to repeat information already recorded in this checkpoint, its required references, or case current case evidence.
7. If records conflict, report the conflict and reconcile the durable documentation before continuing. Do not silently choose an older record and do not invent missing details.

## Authoritative recovered state

Recovery date: **2026-09-13**  
Authority: **explicit human confirmation in the current project session**  
Status: **CASE-001 / tax year 2024 analysis complete and Chief-approved**

The human confirmed the following final state from the preceding project conversation:

- CASE-001 for tax year 2024 completed its document, evidence, tax-analysis, opportunity, calculation-review, and Chief Agent review process.
- The Chief Agent approved the completed 2024 analytical result and closed that preparation process.
- Previously discussed CASE-001 facts and evidence—including driver/work information, EVG, spouse income/Minijob, school fees, household services and other reviewed items—must not automatically be reopened or requested again merely because an older D-024/D-025/D-028 document still labels them provisional or missing.
- The only remaining product boundaries are:
  1. design and implementation of the controlled ELSTER/Finanzamt submission path;
  2. design and implementation of the user interface.
- No ELSTER submission or Finanzamt transmission has occurred.
- The exact final Chief response, final calculation amount, final test count, stage identifier after D-028, and any uncommitted implementation details were not recoverable from GitHub or available cross-session history. They must be marked **not recovered**, never fabricated.

This recovered checkpoint supersedes the older D-028 `HUMAN_REQUIRED` state and the 2026-09-13 operational-readiness audit wherever they describe CASE-001 tax-analysis evidence gaps as currently open. Those older records remain historical evidence, not the current continuation point.

## Current continuation point

Repository cleanup and canonical-state consolidation completed on 2026-09-13.

Project Constitution v2 was explicitly ratified by the Project Owner / Human on 2026-09-13 and is now active in `CONSTITUTION.md`.

Current continuation sequence:

1. Define the stable Agent roles and their bounded contracts.
2. Define the governed Agent Factory and temporary Agent lifecycle.
3. Define the Permission Matrix, separation of duties, budgets, expiry, escalation, and Human Gates.
4. Only after those contracts are accepted, implement the Master Orchestrator under Constitution v2.

No Agent role, permission expansion, or Orchestrator implementation is authorized merely by ratification; each must follow the applicable constitutional governance and Human Gates.

## Cross-session update rule

Whenever a stage is accepted, closed, blocked, resumed, or materially changed, the same governed change set must update:

- this file;
- `CURRENT_STATE.md`;
- `ROADMAP.md` when future work or planned artifacts change;
- `DECISIONS.md` when authority, architecture, or governance changes;
- the relevant detailed document under `docs/`.

A stage is not durably handed off until the checkpoint states:

- what completed;
- what was actually verified;
- what remains;
- the exact next action;
- applicable Human Gates;
- branch, PR, and commit reference when known;
- unknown or unrecovered facts explicitly labeled as such.

## Required references

- `CONSTITUTION.md` — ratified supreme Project Constitution v2.
- `AGENTS.md` — mandatory Agent behavior and governance.
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` — detailed verified/recovered current state.
- `ROADMAP.md` — remaining work and registered future artifacts.
- `DECISIONS.md` — accepted decisions and authority.
- `docs/d027-tax-agent-runtime.md` — executable specialist runtime.
- `docs/d028-chief-tax-auditor.md` — historical Chief implementation and live-test checkpoint.
- `docs/agent-bridge-production.md` — development control plane.
- `docs/local-sync-agent.md` and `docs/windows-relay.md` — host-side operational bridge.

## Authority and safety

This checkpoint records state; it does not grant runtime authority. It does not authorize ELSTER submission, Finanzamt contact, irreversible mutation, secret/permission changes, protected-main merge, or bypass of any Human Gate.


## Repository cleanup checkpoint — 2026-09-13

The active branch was cleaned and canonicalized:

- removed completed bridge trigger/probe artifacts and placeholder write-test files;
- removed unnecessary `.gitkeep` files from populated directories;
- removed superseded D-024/D-025 progress snapshots after preserving durable tax-analysis rules in `docs/d025-tax-calculation-contract.md`;
- replaced accumulated historical content in `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `ROADMAP.md` with concise current-state and future-work records;
- refreshed `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, D-027 runtime documentation, D-028 Chief documentation, and Agent Bridge documentation;
- retained source code, regression tests, security/approval contracts, reusable architecture, verified lessons, and consequential migration/audit evidence.

Git history remains the recovery path for deleted material. No source code, tax evidence, private Drive data, approval data, or audit data was deleted.


## Constitution v2 ratification checkpoint — 2026-09-13

- The Project Owner / Human explicitly approved and ratified Project Constitution v2, including Article 1 and all 20 Articles.
- The ratified text is active at `CONSTITUTION.md` and supersedes the original twelve-principle Constitution.
- Exact Constitution activation commit: `ef935a4ba0493c1f2904d0983614b2b73e656254`.
- Article 1 establishes absolute external-data Default Deny and requires two separate Human approvals: exact-content release approval, followed by exact-recipient/channel transmission approval.
- No Agent, Master Orchestrator, automation, tool, or generic authorization may amend or bypass the Constitution.
- Any future constitutional change requires the exact proposed change, impact/risk disclosure, explicit Project Owner approval, a dedicated commit, Decision Log entry, and checkpoint update.
- The superseded proposal file was removed after activation; Git history remains its recovery path.
- Status: **RATIFIED / IN FORCE**.
